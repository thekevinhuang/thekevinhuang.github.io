Hello World!

I have no idea why you are here or how you got here, but now that you are stay for a tale of a Kevin Huang. One of many.

Here I am on a seemingly random Wednesday night thinking about why it is that I'm coding. Granted, at this point, it is not the first time i've thought about it. It would be strange for me to have just decided this is what I was going to do on a whim.

Though for those that know me well, I do a number of things on a whim. Coding, however, was not one of them. For me a more appropriate question to ask might be "What took so long?"

You know that cheesy line that people say in movies? That the best part of me is you? Well as I've worked for a few years, I've naturally gravitated towards coding. It has always been my favorite part of what I do at work. Learning new languages and applying them to unique problems. I liked building things, especially those that people could use. 

How did this all start?

I started coding in high school with Karel. It was a pseudo language that we did mostly on paper that made an imaginary robot move around in its world and collect beepers. At the time we just laughed at how silly it was. Only equipped with forward motion and a one directional turn, we had to make them navigate puzzles and mazes to collect beepers. It was kind of a game, and it became a bit of an addiction.

Once we got into Java later on, my addiction was confirmed. It became one of my favorite classes. I truly enjoyed the many different approaches to solving problems. I enjoyed stripping down my code and making it efficient and readable. I maybe even enjoyed debugging, if only because of the immense gratification of a working program. I would build features and methods beyond the requirements just because I could.

I was building and creating things that were completely my own.

Maybe that is what it was. When I was growing up, my parents both had full time jobs and I had to figure a lot of things out by myself. I liked creating. My room was littered with legos and had I been better at drawing I would have designed cars.

I guess it's always been a part of me and now I've decided to embarce it.

Let's see what happens on this journey.
Kevin
