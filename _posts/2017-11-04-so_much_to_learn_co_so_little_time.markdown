First and foremost, I apologize to everyone who reads this for the title.

I would also like to apologize for my lack of committment to writing about this experience. I tend to get absorbed in all the various things that I am learning through this camp and on top of the day to day, I never feel like I can do my entries any justice. So then I put them off.

I really would like to write more and share all of the many things that I've been working on. Let's see what I can cover here:

I have learned to design basic websites and use HTML in flexible ways. I have styled ids, classes, and attributes with CSS. I've used preconfigured packages with bootstrap to put up websites and toolbars faster than custom writing them myself.

This is just on the front end.

I've pieced together classes that work together and started emulating real world data structures in Ruby.

I'm honestly blown away by the things that have been covered. I think the mist is starting to clear and I can see how things are going to come together in the end.

The only thing is I wish there was more time so I could learn more and become more skilled faster. I find myself getting tired or being busy with other things and honestly getting frustrated that I didn't make as much progress as I would have liked.

 And as I tumble head first through lesson after lesson, I am not sure I've mastered everything to the degree that I would like but I hope that as topics get more and more complicated, I will get the practice that I need and be able to apply everything...one way or another.
 
 That is one thing that I do appreciate. By the time you start working on more complicated problems, the building blocks have been hammered together, sometimes through hours of staring at one error.
 
Now here I go back to tackling the chaos of development.... web scraping time.
