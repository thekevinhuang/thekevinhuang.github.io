One of the things that I do a lot of/have done a lot of is write macros that perform actions on excel workbooks. This is essentially automating things that would otherwise be many human manual interactions. Copy and pasting, checking and validating many rows of data, report creation, file creation etc.

I think send is super awesome.

I previously didn't really think about the concept of metaprogramming that much. I did understand the concept of macros that automated tasks but mostly thought about it from the perspective of another language. So if you had told me that someone wrote a python script to put together ruby code, I wouldn't have been thrown off.

I think it is something that will potentially impact where we go from here with computers in the general public.

Some friends and I were discussing the importance of programming for everyday people.

Would future generations have to take programming/computer science classes just like there are foreign language requirements? Or would classes be focused on perhaps making children more comfortable with the logic that is utilized and less on specific structure/syntax?

I do think that as humans become more reliant on computers and use them to advance more fields of human knowledge, the better that people can interact with their computers and understand their capabilities, the more use we can get out of them. After all, a person needs to know how to use their tool in order to benefit.

So I believe that with languages like ruby, where the structure and rules tend to be much closer to the way we speak on a day to day basis, this could indicate a future trend.

Maybe the everyday person might not need to know the specific structure. I think if they understand the logic, things like metaprogramming would be able to bridge some of the gap. Just like compilers translate the code we write into machine language, programming will likely become more like normal human language. So with a basic understanding of logic you might get something like:

say "Hello World!" ten times. and have that work. Who knows?
