I had worked on scraping at work before. I remember there was a software called Automation Anywhere or something similar that you could use to write simple macros for pulling website information into csvs or excel files.

The problem with the way it worked was that it was very indescriminate in the way that it took the data. A large part of the workload was cleaning, parsing, and creating formulas to isolate the usable data. It didn't require any knowledge of HTML. It was during this time that many of my thought processes became more programmatic in nature. I had to create formulas that took consistent results from scrapes. Changes in results meant changes in all the data parsing after.

Scraping was, to me, this mysterious magic black box that I could never understand.

Fast forward a few years... scraping still isn't my strongest suit. As I continue on to one of my portfolio projects in ruby, I am glad that I will get more experience. I will get better at scraping or die trying.

But this time, the game has changed. Instead of sorting through unstructured products, I now know the basics of HTML and Ruby so that none of the data that I scrape should be unstructured.

What's more is that I now have more efficient scrapes. These scrapes can also be reused with minimal effort. This is also the first topic that has truly synthesized ruby with the web aspect of what i have learned in object oriented ruby.

Another effect of scraping that I didn't really anticipate was a deeper understanding of web pages. What I previously thought was hidden in the mysteries of the internet, aren't actually that hidden. The information is actually very accessable if you have the right tools. I'm excited to finally use everything that i've learned and create something that plugs into the real world.
