...but Google will...

As I have worked through many coding lessons and gotten stuck more than a few times, one thing has always helped me out. In my previous coding work and even now as I continue to learn, "Googling" something almost always gets you out of the hole you are in.

Especially if you know how to phrase your issue, it is almost certain that someone will have been there first. This is, for me, both a comfort and a concern.

On one hand, yes I do like knowing that if I need help on something or can't figure something out someone can help me.

But on the other hand, I feel like everything that I'm doing is something that someone has already done.

I know this is almost a silly sentiment coming from a student working their way through a curriculum but I can't help it. I do feel a little anxious to move forward and pave my own path.

Maybe programming is actually more a reminder that you know almost nothing!


And that is how I will try to get to the point where I may one day contribute.
