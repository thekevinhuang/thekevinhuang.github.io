                                    Here is another curious thing about data structures that I've learned about: data structures aren't necessarily  
                                    new basic constructs like arrays or linked lists.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When I found out that there were all these other data structures like stacks, queues, trees, and graphs I was surprised 
                                    that I could build anything of importance while the only knowing/using arrays and hashes. What I didn't understand at the time 
                                    was that many of the data structures listed above are implemented using arrays and linked lists. They are less of their own 
                                    basic data storage forms, and are more of a way of thinking and organizing data to model specific problems. The "simplest" of 
                                    these are stacks and queues.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <bold>Stacks</bold>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Imagine if you had a box (with a closed bottom) and it was just wide enough to hold one jenga piece at a time. It is a very narrow but tall box. 
                                    If you put in a piece, the top is open and so you should be able to take that piece back out (let's ignore how difficult it would be 
                                    to reach into such a narrow long box to retrieve said piece). But what happens when you put in two pieces? You can only pull out 
                                    the first piece after you have already removed the second piece. This is what is referred to as a LIFO or last in, first out 
                                    structure. Only the last thing that was put into the stack, can be accessed at any given time.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Stacks can easily be implemented with tools that we are already familiar with. With arrays for example, we can push new elements and 
                                    pop them just as easily. Linked lists can be used to represent a stack as well, but in order to keep the access of the latest element 
                                    at time complexity O(1) instead of adding to the tail end of the linked list, you have to add and delete at the head end.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So who cares? If they are just different ways to use tools that we are familiar with already, why do we need to know about them? 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Most data structures represent a way of thinking about data manipulation. A (somewhat contrived) example 
                                    may be that you want to check if, in a string, there are immediately adjacent character duplicates. As you comb 
                                    through a string, throw each character into your stack, if the next character doesn't match, just pop it back out 
                                    and throw the next character into your stack. If it does match what is in your stack, push the character and you can even 
                                    count the number of consecutives. While this is a somewhat niche usage, stacks are utilized to help computers process 
                                    mathematical expressions that contain parentheses. Adding opening parentheses and not popping them until you have their corresponding 
                                    closing parentheses becomes much easier to organize. A formula can have 1000 parentheses and the computer can systematically 
                                    push and pop without having to check from the beginning every single time. A similar process is used to check for brackets in code.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <bold>Queues</bold>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So what about queues? Queues, like stacks, represent a way to represent real world situations. Much like the British 
                                    English usage of the word, queues can be used to represent a line of users waiting for service. This structure, unlike the 
                                    above, is a FIFO or first in first out. The first person to line up in a line is the first person to get served. This has 
                                    much more obvious real world data resemblence. If you were ordering food at a fast food establishment, you would be upset 
                                    if someone just inserted themselves in front of you. In the same fashion, if you were waiting to chat with a customer representative 
                                    on a website, you trust that the order in which you are added is the same order that you are served. An implementation where 
                                    users were just randomly inserted, and removed could result in some people never being served!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The more that I learn about the various data structures, the more I see their value as a part of the developer's toolkit. 
                                    I see a greater overlap between the coded world and the one we live in. And that is kind of the point of all this right? 
                                    How do we best solve real world problems?
                                </p>
