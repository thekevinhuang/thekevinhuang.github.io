                                    Something that I've been meaning to do is explore some of the principles of software engineering 
                                    in the scope of the real world. At its core, writing code is a way to solve problems. From 
                                    doing some simple calculations, to managing the purchases of millions of people, software engineering 
                                    is just creating solutions to tackle challenges. People have been solving problems for long before 
                                    computers even came into the picture.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    One thing that I was thinking about recently was the NYC subway system:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <img src="https://untappedcities-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/NYC-Animated-History-Subway-Map-GIF.gif" alt="nyc-subway-gif">
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If we look at that map, we can see how the various lines have grown over the years, at the time of writing 
                                    115 years to be exact. And in addition to being one of 
                                    the first subway systems in the world (9th according to 
                                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_metro_systems">Wikipedia</a>)
                                    , it is also one of the busiest, (also 9th according to ridership), and it has the most stations of them all.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So what?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If we take Google, the most visited website in the world, as a comparison, you might see some similarities. Just like in 1904 
                                    when the first subway opened up, Google started with about one station in 1998: Google.com. Just like the opening of the first 
                                    station at City Hall on October 27, 1904, Google probably only planned on what they needed for their first station. 
                                    They likely didn't plan ahead to build out infrastructure for 
                                    what exists in their current empire. Engineers at Google never would have been able to set out and prepare for billions 
                                    of hits, a mail platform, payment platforms, a mobile OS, etc. all at the same time.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The subway that existed back when it first opened also would never be able to handle the usage that it gets now. As new needs 
                                    arose, more stations, track, and employees were added. Google also added more code, more systems, and more employees as they experienced 
                                    growth. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Not all is always good though, sometimes even the best laid plans fall through. Google has invested a lot of resources into products 
                                    that don't end up working or standing the test of time (RIP Inbox and Google Reader among others). The NY subway station also had 
                                    issues with keeping tracks open. Starting from the 50s all the way through the mid 80s, there were many 
                                    track closures, decreased maintenance of tracks, which led to more frequent breakdowns and rampant graffiti.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Ok, I think i've written enough about trains and Google. What are the takeaways here?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The building of the subway system to me had me thinking a lot about optimal architecture. Some acronyms often 
                                    used in engineering include: DRY and YAGNI. I couldn't help but see that mirrored in the subway lines.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself.</strong> Subway lines definitely intersect, but not every single subway line needs 
                                    to directly connect to every subway station. Trains can handle their own subset of the network, only ensuring 
                                    that they don't collide with one another. Well structured code should also be able to handle their own tasks, 
                                    only ensuring that they play well with the other pieces. It is important, however, to make sure that you start off building 
                                    what you need before thinking about making it pretty. If it is critical to lay a piece of track to connect two stations, 
                                    you should do it, even if it might encroach on other tracks that you have completed previously. Then fix it. Combine the subway 
                                    station, improve the efficiency and flow, all without sacrificing a working track.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>YAGNI - You Aren't Gonna Need It.</strong> You shouldn't build things out just because you might need it in the 
                                    future. If NY planned for every single potential route for a train, the entirety of the ground underneath 
                                    the city would be hollow and the buildings would probably all fall in. Tackle the expansions and features 
                                    you need, as you need them. Otherwise, you aren't going to need it. Personally, especially at the beginning of a new project, 
                                    I find myself wanting to tackle the world. I'll worry about all the associations in the data for every single model I want 
                                    in the app and suddenly, there is a huge cavernous "network" of tunnels to connect data but once I start building on it, 
                                    things are more confusing than they should be had I taken it step by step.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I'd like to introduce another one: <strong>MORAL - Maintain Or Regret A Lot.</strong> I think this speaks 
                                    to a lot about writing and maintaining code. Often times people work really hard to put together a 
                                    working product. Once it is completed, they just trust that it will keep working. Just like the trains 
                                    that fell into disarray, not keeping up with updates and reviewing the functionality of your code, could 
                                    result in strange bugs or catastrophic errors that you have no idea how to fix. Many months later, all of your packages 
                                    are a couple versions behind and you are caught not pushing forward but working hard to just get things back to working. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    On the flip side, we do need to be careful about not preparing at all for the future. a complete lack of scalability 
                                    or code that is written completely without regard for compatibility could end up costing a lot down the line. It might 
                                    be harder to maintain or involve more refactoring to keep things DRY. Creating a one lane subway track for example would be 
                                    a bad idea in almost any case. We have to imagine that after shipping people one way, we might need to provide a way to get them 
                                    back again.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So what does this all mean? I think the main takeaway is that engineering, even though it is a technical profession 
                                    also has a tightrope walk and some artistry to get the correct balance of upfront work and long term sustainability. 
                                    As I work more to build up my skills as a developer, I need to remind myself to think about what we need now, but not 
                                    by completely eschewing future utility.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So I hope you found this moderately interesting, I will keep on thinking about other real world parallels to 
                                    the developer's digital world.
                                </p>
