                                <p>
                                    Up until now, most of the data structures that we have covered didn't need to be organized in any way. 
                                    You could append whatever values you wanted to your stack, queue, or list. In fact, they were built specifically 
                                    for that purpose. Either LIFO or FIFO, they were meant to control solely the order which you interacted with elements.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But let's talk about a structure that "requires" organization.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <bold>Binary Trees</bold>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Now what is curious is the difference between the way trees are visualized and the way that they are represented/implemented. 
                                    Their visualization is almost two dimensional. The basic structure is similar to that of a linked list. Data is stored in nodes. 
                                    The nodes, instead of only linking to the next node (or the previous node also in the case of doubly linked lists) now can 
                                    potentially link to two nodes: right and left.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Each subsequent node can have its own left and right children and so on. This results in what honestly is more like roots or 
                                    an upside down tree, but branches I guess.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Now is probably a good time to backpedal on a claim I made earlier that the tree requires organization. This isn't strictly true. 
                                    You don't have to sort or order your nodes in any particular manner if you don't want to, but you might as well use an array 
                                    then. In order to find values if there are no relationships between parents and children, it is just a list like object with 
                                    random numbers and searching still requires you to traverse the whole list.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So what makes the organization important?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <bold>SEARCH TREES!</bold>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Let's take an example of a tree filled with numbers that was sorted so that the following was true: Left children had smaller 
                                    values and Right children had larger values. And let's also enforce that this is true for all nodes in all the trees and subtrees. 
                                     Now if we start with a list of 100 numbers and pick a number in the middle to start, 
                                    if we are looking for a certain value, our first comparison to the middle(head) node would allow us to eliminate half the numbers 
                                    immediately. Let's say the numbers were 1-100 and we started with 50. If we were looking for the number 32, we could 
                                    immediately eliminate all the numbers to the right of 50 (i.e. 51-100). All those numbers we would never have to search. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    What happens next? We go again to the middle of the remaining numbers. 1-49. (49 - 1)/2 = 24. Now we can eliminate all the 
                                    numbers <= to 24. (49-25)/2 = 12. 12 + 25 = 37. Next comparison eliminates everything between 37 and 49. (36-25)/2 = 5.5 ~6.
                                    31 is the next comparison point and everything between 25 and 31 is eliminated. (36 - 32)/2 = 2 so 34 is the next comparison. 
                                    34, 35, 36 eliminated. leaving only 32 and 33.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So what does that mean? We made 6 or 7 comparisons to find the number instead of the potentially 100 that we might have needed 
                                    in an unordered list, searching one by one. Generally you can calculate the time to find things in binary search trees 
                                    using O(log(n)) time as opposed to the full O(n) search time you might expect otherwise.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Now there is more to the binary tree structure, including definitions and additional applications but I 
                                    wanted to touch on the power of organizing your data. More to come in the future.
                                </p>
