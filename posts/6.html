                                <p>
                                    Having recently completed my Flatiron coursework, I thought I knew so much. But apparently not everything (again)!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Following the program, I start to prepare for interviews. 
                                    While I prepare to talk about me, my code, and my qualifications, I notice something keep coming up in my searches.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <bold>Data Structures</bold>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I have learned a lot throughout the program. I learned and became familiar with backend MVC implementations, 
                                    customized API, Object orientation, functional programming, asynchrous programming, among other topics. 
                                    But one thing that I realized I was missing was more foundational. There are thousands of problems and katas to attempt 
                                    in the search to becoming a hacking master. A lot of patterns were similar and common across them.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Now these were things that maybe aren't used constantly when you are creating components in React or
                                    creating an application, but they do help create a way to organize and think about problems. Initially, 
                                    I thought that these other structures were building blocks like arrays or strings that I just never had 
                                    any exposure to. Turns out that isn't really the case. A lot of the implementations of data structures 
                                    actually utilize arrays or hashes. So to get up to speed and learn how wrong I was, I've been watching 
                                    a very helpful series of videos on data structures on <a href="https://youtu.be/92S4zgXN17o">Youtube</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    At this point everyone knows about arrays and hashes and how they can store data of many different types. 
                                    I didn't really understand the implementation in terms of memory. The array structure itself is generally a 
                                    continuous block of memory. This is how the array achieves high speed of lookup performance because the computer 
                                    can easily calculate where the nth item is by starting at the beginning and calculating n times size of data. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Since when you create an array it is a fixed block of continuous memory, there are some inefficiencies in adding 
                                    elements to an array beyond its size. Every time you reach the limit of the 
                                    array you have to create a new, larger, empty array and copy all the items into the new array.
                                     but I haven't worked with applications large enough to even experience that.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There is another structure that is often compared against arrays: the linked list. Prior to this Youtube series, 
                                    I had never known that linked lists existed, let alone implemented one. The concept of a linked list is as follows. 
                                    There is a class or an object called a node. The node usually stores some data element and a reference to the next node. 
                                    That's it! It is super easy to add a new node to the end of a linked list, but in order to find data you have to start 
                                    at the head and follow it until you find what you are looking for. Linked list manipulation is all about traversing the 
                                    linked list and either creating, inserting, or deleting the references to other nodes. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In addition to the ease of creating new nodes to append, (without having to create a completely new array) there is 
                                    the added (yet pretty much unseen) benefit of having nodes be stored throughout the memory and not requiring a single 
                                    block of memory.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There are quite a few questions I've seen on various websites that involve linked lists, but now that I know about them 
                                    I should be better equipped to tackle them.
                                </p>
