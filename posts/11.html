                                <p>
                                    My wife and I recently watched the show Rhythm and Flow on Netflix.
                                    If you aren’t familiar with it, it is essentially The Voice but for rap.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Over the course of the show, they covered a couple different elements that sets rappers apart:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Content</li>
                                        <li>Approachability</li>
                                        <li>Stage Presence</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I was inspired by the show to write some of my own rhymes and I did so
                                     to perform at a friend’s baby shower to honor the daughter they are expecting. 
                                     As I wrote, I found there to be a lot of commonalities between rap and writing code.
                                </p>
                                
                                <span class="image fit"><img src="https://gph.is/1bRXORi" alt="baby-dancing"></span>
                                    
                                <p>
                                    This maybe sounds stupid, but hear me out. Also, I don’t claim to be a good lyricist, 
                                    I just want to walk through my thought process.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Content</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    No doubt, content is key. Is what I’m writing applicable to the task at hand? 
                                    What are you trying to accomplish and how do you plan on getting there? 
                                    For the baby shower rap for example I wanted a structure of the following:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Intro to couple</li>
                                        <li>Cool stuff about mom <strong>X5</strong></li>
                                        <li>Cool stuff about dad <strong>X5</strong></li>
                                        <li>Line combining two</li>
                                        <li>Cool stuff about dad <strong>X5</strong></li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This is exactly the approach that I might want to use when coming up with some sort of program/algorithm.
                                     You think about the parts that you need and then put them together. 
                                     Each person’s section is 5 sets of 2 rhyming lines with specific details about each person inputted.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    So we can think about each person as a collection of 5 different facts that I would like to incorporate:
                                </p>

                                <pre><code>
    mom = [mfact1, mfact2, mfact3, mfact4, mfact5];
    dad = [dfact1, dfact2, dfact3, dfact4, dfact5];
    baby = [bfact1, bfact2, bfact3, bfact4, bfact5];
                                </code></pre>
                                <p>
                                    Each set takes a fact and returns the appropriate lines. 
                                    This divides the task up into much smaller and approachable bits. 
                                    Then you repeat this task with different facts from different people and you are done! Sort of.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Approachability</strong>>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Sure, I know the structure of what I want to write, but how approachable is it? 
                                    This is a real fine line. If what you’ve written is too long, or the references too obscure, 
                                    or complicated, it can be difficult for people to understand what you have put down.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For example, if I had chosen to plan out the rap structure above on one line.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Intro to couple; Cool stuff about mom X 5; Cool stuff about dad X 5; Line combining two; Cool stuff about baby X 5
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There is definitely decreased approachability and readability. 
                                    Sometimes rap can have that issue where 100 words just went and you have no idea what just happened. 
                                    Coding can have the same problem.    
                                </p>
                                
                                <pre><code>
    Math.max((array1[0]+array1[1])/2,(array2[0]+array2[2])/2);     
                                </code></pre>
                                
                                <p>
                                    The above is a statement that finds the larger of two averages of the first two elements in two different arrays.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So is this:
                                </p>

                                <pre><code>
    let avgArray1 = (array1[0]+array1[1])/2;
    let avgArray2 = (array2[0]+array2[1])/2;
    
    Math.max(avgArray1, avgArray2);     
                                </code></pre>

                                <p>
                                    The second is technically longer, yes. But if you can assume that the person knew what they 
                                    were doing in calculating the average, you can read the last statement and 
                                    understand what is going on immediately.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Just like having too many syllables on one line makes the “flow” hard to follow and 
                                    your metaphors and content get lost in the mess, short statements 
                                    in your programs help keep them easy to follow.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That brings us to references. There are often rap references that go over people’s heads. 
                                    Sometimes they are really clever. Sometimes they are simply confusing.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Check out my post on how confusing names and references can be <a href="/posts/10">here</a>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There is another consideration to make about efficiency but I will write about that in another post.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Stage Presence</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    How do you deliver your message? Are you committed? Is this something you feel comfortable delivering?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As is mentioned a lot in the show, if you aren’t able to engage your audience, you won’t make it as an artist.
                                     Similarly, if you are unable to talk about the code that you have written or share your thought process, 
                                     it makes it difficult to show people that you know what you are talking about.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As I try to walk the fine line of accomplishing writing effective code that is approachable, efficient, and easy 
                                    enough to understand I have to remember to try to talk about it. So this was my attempt for the day. Hopefully this 
                                    has been an amusing short read about somethings that you might not have thought you would connect today.
                                </p>
