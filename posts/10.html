                                    The age old question. Would roses smell as sweet if they were called glarfls?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It doesn't sound as good honestly. And I would argue that there is a lot in a name. I think 
                                    a lot of engineers would agree. This is one piece of advice that I've heard a lot when writing 
                                    and sharing code. Use good names!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Back to the streets of NY to try and relate engineering with every day life.
                                </p>

                                    Let's take the island of manhattan to start.
                                </p>
                                
                                <span class="image fit"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Manhattan_neighborhoods.png/1280px-Manhattan_neighborhoods.png" alt="neighborhoods-of-manhattan"></span>

                                    A little messy so let's take a step back. Before we get into neighborhoods, let's start with one of the features 
                                    of Manhattan that makes it so easy to navigate. <strong>THE GRID</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/2RlHoeK25farS/giphy.gif" alt="tron-the-grid">
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    With the exception of some of the extremes edges of the island and the honestly confusing south of the island (where West 4th 
                                    starts intersecting with streets and avenues), most streets are organized in an approachable fashion.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Vertical roads are generally avenues and horizontal roads are the streets. This makes things easy to locate.
                                </p>
                                <pre><code>
                                    arrayX = [thing1, thing2, thing3];
                                    arrayY = [thing5, thing6, thing9];

                                    for(let x=0; x&lt;arrayY.length; x++){
                                        for (let i=0; i &lt; arrayX.length; i++) {
                                            modifyFunction(arrayY[x],arrayX[i]);
                                        }
                                    }
                                </code></pre>
                                <p>
                                    Here we have are looping through two arrays. This structure can form something like we have 
                                    been working with: a grid. For each pass through an element of arrayY, we go through all of the values 
                                    of arrayX. Then we move to the next element in arrayY. This could even be a rudimentary representation of 
                                    an avenue/street structure. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    While working through this array, we create new variables i and x to count our way through the number of 
                                    items in the arrays. We don't really need to know anything about the number represented by i or x. It is easy to 
                                    increment and after we finish the navigation we don't really need to use it again. This is a great situation 
                                    to use simple letter names to represent values.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Now here I believe middle school education did us somewhat of a disservice. We spent so many hours and so much 
                                    time trying to find the value of X where X could represent everything and was used in just about all situations. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Solving a problem about trains that will, for some reason, collide after some time of traveling at different speeds? 
                                    Let's just set one speed as X and the other as Y. By the time you are finished with your calculation, which one is which? 
                                    In the above array example, if we wanted to know which one represented avenues and which one was streets, shouldn't we have 
                                    just named them that way? At the time maybe it was faster just to call them X and Y. After a while, after some hundreds of lines of code
                                    , we aren't sure why we used the x counter for arrayY or what arrayY really is.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This habit dies hard, especially in situations where you want to do a quick calculation. Let's 
                                    think back to the grid of Manhattan and our made up array example. Let's say we wanted to add things to our grid. 
                                    above we are using some function not displayed called modifyFunction on the elements in the arrays.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But wait, you couldn't really tell any of that from the above could you? modifyFunction could be doing anything, adding 
                                    stoplights, buildings, sewers, garbage cans, really anything. If you had 100 people contributing to this, every single person 
                                    would have to figure out what all the parts do. In fact, the only thing that is understandable is how you are navigating the arrays.
                                </p>
                                
                                <pre><code>
                                    streetArray = [firstStreet, secondStreet, thirdStreet];
                                    avenueArray = [fifthAvenue, sixthAvenue, ninethAvenue];
                                    
                                    for(let x=0; x&lt;avenueArray.length; x++){
                                        for (let i=0; i&lt;streetArray.length; i++) {
                                            addRoseGarden(avenueArray[x],streetArray[i]);
                                        }
                                    }        
                                </code></pre>

                                    In addition to creating more readible and shareable code for others, names are good for summarizing 
                                    information. Remember those neighborhoods that we saw earlier, you could write out each neighborhood as 
                                    a set of boundaries fourtyFifthAndThirdTofiftyNinethAndNineth or midtown. So too much information in your name 
                                    isn't good either. Once again we end on the conclusion that there is some balance in your names. Approachable, 
                                    but not overwhelming, true artistry.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A good name can smell sweet after all.
                                </p>
